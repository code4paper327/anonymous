# TwiBot-22
This is an adaptation of the [TwiBot-22 Repository](https://github.com/LuoUndergradXJTU/TwiBot-22) to utilise models which are adapted to our available data. The BotHunter, SATAR and DeeProBot models are available there.

## Installation
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## To Note
Each model in `src/` has its own executable code with their own dependencies which read from `datasets/`.
