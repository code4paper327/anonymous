# Baseline Source

This is where the source code is available for all of our baselines and how they were computed.

## Baseline models implementations

This is an adaptation of the [TwiBot-22 Repository](https://github.com/LuoUndergradXJTU/TwiBot-22) to utilise models which are adapted to our available data. The BotHunter, SATAR, DeeProBot, FriendBot, EvolveBot, BGSRD, BotRGCN models are available there.

CACL model is implemented using the official implementation at [CACL](https://github.com/SirryChen/CACL). Similarly, DigitalDNA was used from official implementation [ddna](https://github.com/WAFI-CNR/ddna-toolbox).
